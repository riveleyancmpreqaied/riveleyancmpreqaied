Here’s how a typical rollover works:

Using the example above, on the original due date you don’t repay the $500 loan. Instead, you pay only the $75 fee and roll over the $500 loan for another two weeks. The rollover will cost you another $75 fee.
Two weeks after rolling over the loan, you still owe the lender $500 for the loan, plus the new $75 fee.
The bottom line: The cost of the original $500 loan has gone from $75 to $150 due to the rollover.
